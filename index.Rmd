## Internet Penetration Rate and Local corruption

This plot explore the negative relationship between provincial internet penetration rate and degree of local corruption in different economic zones of China. As the development of E-government in recent years facilitates citizens to supervise government daily operation, provinces with higher internet penetration rate appear to have fewer corruption cases.

This finding implies that better infrastructures can empower citizens to monitor local governments as news media, reshaping the system of anti-corruption institutions.

## Different period of government and Local corruption

This plot explore how degree of corruption in different economic zones varied in different period of Chinese government. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) uses 5 years as cycle to institute national plans and policies. The plot indicates that in different period of 5 years plan the degree of corruption in East, West and Central have gradual decrease due to the reform of Chinese anti-corruption system. But Northeast appears to be an outlier. 

This finding implies that Chinese government should pay more attention to the anti-corruption issues in Northeast economic zone.

## Corrupt Officials and GDP
GDP is strongly correlated with corruption. In the provinces with lower GDP, the proportion of corrupt officials among all non-private employees is higher. As central, west and northeast parts of China is not as wealthy as east rejion, the proportion of corrupt officials is higher in those three regions.

[Data Source](https://data.stats.gov.cn/index.htm)

```{r}
corruption <- corruption %>%
mutate(corruption_per = corruption_officials / non_private_employee)
ggplot(data = corruption, mapping = aes(x = provincial_GDP, y = corruption_per,shape = region, alpha = 0.4)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 2.7645, color = "orange", size = 1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 14243, color = "orange", size = 1)
```

## Corrupt Officials and Provincial Expenditure
The grapgh aims at exploring the correlation between the amount of the officials convicted of corruption and the provincial expenditure in each province in 2017. We can see clearly that the higher the provincial expenditure is, the more corrupt officials are in the province in general. Officials are easily tempted by the large sum of money at every stage of government's budget.There exists positive correlation between such two variables.

```{r}
corruption %>% 
  filter(year == "2017") %>%
  group_by(province) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = provincial_expenditure, 
                         y = reorder(province, provincial_expenditure),
                         fill = corruption_officials)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")  +
  scale_fill_continuous(name = "provincial_ expenditure") +
  labs(title ="Correlation between Corruption Officials and Provincial Expenditure",
         x = "Provincial Expenditure",
       y = "Province")
